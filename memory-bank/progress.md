# Progress: Agent Swarm MCP Server

## Completed Work

### ✅ Project Foundation (Session: 5/23/2025)
**Status**: Complete and verified
- Project directory structure established
- Python virtual environment created and configured
- All core dependencies installed and working
- Basic FastAPI application structure implemented

### ✅ Core Infrastructure (Session: 5/23/2025)
**Status**: Complete and tested
- FastAPI app with proper configuration
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Root endpoint with navigation (`/`)
- MCP protocol placeholder endpoint (`/mcp`)
- Agent suggestion endpoint (`/suggest-agents`) with example implementations

### ✅ Documentation (Session: 5/23/2025)
**Status**: Complete and comprehensive
- Detailed README.md with setup instructions
- Complete memory bank with project context
- Automatic API documentation via FastAPI
- Clear project structure and usage guidelines

### ✅ Development Environment (Session: 5/23/2025)
**Status**: Complete and verified
- Virtual environment with dependencies
- Correct Windows command syntax documented
- Server tested and confirmed working
- Development workflow established

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ FastAPI server starts successfully
- ✅ All endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ JSON responses properly formatted
- ✅ Automatic API documentation available
- ✅ Development environment fully functional
- ✅ `/suggest-agents` endpoint properly accepts EmpireDescriptionRequest and returns AgentSpecificationResponse list

### What's Not Working
- ⚠️ MCP protocol implementation (placeholder only)
- ⚠️ Agent registration system (not implemented)
- ⚠️ Authentication/authorization (not implemented)
- ⚠️ Logging system (basic only)
- ⚠️ Agent suggestion logic (placeholder implementation with static examples)

## Next Phase Requirements

### Priority 1: MCP Protocol Implementation
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Research MCP specification
**Tasks**:
- Define MCP message structures
- Implement protocol handlers
- Add message validation
- Create agent communication patterns

### Priority 2: Agent Management
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: MCP protocol foundation
**Tasks**:
- Agent registration endpoints
- Agent discovery mechanism
- State management system
- Connection monitoring

### Priority 3: Production Readiness
**Estimated Effort**: High
**Dependencies**: Core functionality complete
**Tasks**:
- Authentication system
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling improvements
- Configuration management
- Deployment scripts

## Technical Debt

### None Identified
- Clean code structure established
- Proper type hints throughout
- Standard patterns followed
- No shortcuts taken in foundation

## Blockers

### None Current
- All dependencies resolved
- Development environment stable
- No external service dependencies
- Clear path forward established

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- ✅ Technology stack proven and stable
- ✅ Project structure follows best practices
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive
- ✅ Development environment reliable

### Medium Risk Items
- ⚠️ MCP protocol specification understanding
- ⚠️ Agent state management complexity
- ⚠️ Scaling considerations for multiple agents

### Mitigation Strategies
- Research MCP protocol thoroughly before implementation
- Design stateless architecture where possible
- Plan for horizontal scaling from early stages
