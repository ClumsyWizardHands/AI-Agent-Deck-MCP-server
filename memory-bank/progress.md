# Progress Log

## Latest Update: 2025-01-23

### Major Improvements Completed ✅

1. **Empire Builder UI**
   - Created full-featured web interface for empire description input
   - Implemented dynamic field management with add/remove functionality
   - Added auto-resizing textareas for better UX
   - Integrated with backend API for agent generation

2. **Agent Generation System Overhaul**
   - Rewrote master prompt with synthesis→analysis→design approach
   - Agents now have singular, specific purposes
   - Removed domain categories for cleaner focus
   - Direct ExtendedEmpireDescription usage (no conversion)

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Fixed JSON parsing issues in Claude service
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Enhanced error handling throughout
   - Added test suite for validation

4. **Results**
   - Successfully generating 20 focused, implementable agents
   - Each agent has concrete technical approaches (specific APIs, tools)
   - Agents work together as an integrated system
   - UI displays all generated agents correctly

### What's Working
- Complete flow from empire description → agent generation → UI display
- Agents are specific and buildable (e.g., "Twitter Velocity Monitor" not "Social Media Analyzer")
- System handles complex empires with multiple fields
- Debug logging helps track issues

### Known Issues
- None currently identified

### Next Steps
1. User testing with real empire descriptions
2. Consider adding agent export functionality (JSON download)
3. Potentially add agent editing/refinement features
4. Consider visualization of agent dependencies

### Git Status
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Commit: 7395ceb "Major improvements to agent generation system"
