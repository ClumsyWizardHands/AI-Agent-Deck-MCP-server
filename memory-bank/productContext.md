# Product Context: Agent Swarm MCP Server

## Problems Being Solved

### Primary Problem
- **Agent Communication Gap**: Need a standardized way for multiple AI agents to communicate and coordinate using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Swarm Coordination**: Enable multiple agents to work together on complex tasks requiring distributed intelligence
- **Protocol Standardization**: Implement MCP standards for agent-to-agent and agent-to-system communications

### Secondary Problems
- **Scalability**: Current agent systems often lack proper coordination mechanisms
- **Extensibility**: Need a platform that can grow with evolving agent capabilities
- **Performance**: Real-time agent coordination requires low-latency communication

## User Goals

### Primary Users: AI Agent Developers
- **Goal**: Easily integrate their agents with a standardized MCP server
- **Need**: Clear API documentation and simple integration patterns
- **Expectation**: High reliability and performance for production use

### Secondary Users: System Integrators
- **Goal**: Deploy agent swarm capabilities in existing systems
- **Need**: Flexible deployment options and configuration
- **Expectation**: Production-ready server with monitoring and logging

## System Expectations

### Functional Expectations
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full adherence to Model Context Protocol standards
- **REST API**: Clean, well-documented RESTful endpoints
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking operations for high throughput
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with meaningful responses

### Non-Functional Expectations
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for standard operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error recovery
- **Scalability**: Handle hundreds of concurrent agent connections
- **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Integration Expectations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs with examples
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics
- **Deployment**: Easy deployment with containerization support
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
