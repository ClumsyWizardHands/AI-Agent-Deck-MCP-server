# Project Brief: Agent Swarm MCP Server

## Strategic Mission
Build a FastAPI-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables agent swarm operations and coordination.

## Technical Mission
Create a robust, scalable API server using modern Python frameworks that can:
- Serve as an MCP server for agent communications
- Handle asynchronous operations for agent swarm coordination
- Provide extensible architecture for future agent capabilities
- Maintain high performance and reliability

## Core Objectives
1. **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Build a server that can handle Model Context Protocol communications
2. **Agent Swarm Coordination**: Enable multiple agents to coordinate through this central server
3. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancements and additional agent capabilities
4. **Performance**: Ensure fast, asynchronous operations suitable for real-time agent interactions
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation and API specifications

## Success Criteria
- Functional FastAPI server with proper error handling
- MCP protocol endpoints ready for implementation
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Extensible architecture for agent swarm features
- Production-ready deployment configuration
